This application will start its initial phase with only admin id. The username will be "ADMIN" and the password will be "admin". The admin can change any information.

In order to demonstrate this process for hospitals, the hospital authority will need to register into the site via filling up the registration form. Once the registration process is over the individual hospital authorities will have their own ids and have access to edit necessary information for example changing the vaccine capacity of the hospital, the dose date of the registered people.

Educational institutions will also follow similar procedures with their own information criterias. Student informations can be added to the database by upload csv type files. The university can also download all the student data in pdf form. The universities can also edit their student information.

The students whos informations are already uploaded in the site database through their educational institution will only be allowed to register for vaccine registration. Once the student registration is done the file containing student informations can be downloaded by the user in pdf form.

If any user forgets their password they can use the forgot password option to create new password.
